# Simple Library 

A simple example of OOP programming.

In this example, the Book class represents a book with a title, author, and ID number. The Bookshelf class represents a bookshelf that can hold multiple books. The Library class represents a library that can hold multiple bookshelves.

The "add_book" method allows the user to add a book to a bookshelf, and the add_bookshelf method allows the user to add a bookshelf to the library. In the code example, a library, bookshelf, and book are created and added to each other in the appropriate manner.

The "print_book" method allows the user to print a book in a bookshelf, and the "print_bookshelf" method allows the user to print list of book in a bookshelf in the library.
